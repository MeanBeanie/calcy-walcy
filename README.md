# calcy walcy

im insanely bored so i made a basic scientific calculator(oo)

does basic sin/cos/tan and supports all of pemdas so you get exponents and parenthesis(wow shocking)

just run `./calc ""` with your math in the quotes(so complicated)

example: `./calc "1 + (2*3)"` and it will output 7

whitespace has no relavance and so is entirely upto readability

may have a slight issue with going right to left without parenthesis instead of left to right
